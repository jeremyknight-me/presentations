# Back to Basics: <span>ADO.NET</span>

Originally presented for the Baton Rouge .NET User Group during their Jan 2020 meeting.

**Topic Description**

Microsoft says Entity Framework (EF) is “an object-relational mapper (or ORM) that eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write”. This session will show the basics of data access that ORMs like EF tend to obscure. It will also show how to use <span>ADO.NET</span> to integrate with and augment EF when it falls short.
