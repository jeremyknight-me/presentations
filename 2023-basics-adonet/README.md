# Back to Basics: ADO.NET

“Back to Basics: ADO.NET” is a beginner topic and I’ll be assuming no ADO.NET experience. All code examples will be in C# and description is as follows:

> Microsoft says Entity Framework (EF) is “an object-relational mapper (or ORM) that eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write”. This session will show the basics of data access that ORMs like EF tend to obscure. It will also show how to use ADO.NET to integrate with and augment EF when it falls short.
